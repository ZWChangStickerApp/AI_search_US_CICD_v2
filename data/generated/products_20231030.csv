How to make custom stickers
Here are some common questions on how to make and order custom stickers







The editor doesn't recognize my cutline, what should I do?



If the editor doesn't cut your file correctly, just leave us a comment and we'll fix it for you manually






Can I print smaller stickers than 1"" x 1"" (3x3cm)?


Yes! If you want a smaller size, please choose the closest possible size in the editor and leave us a comment with the final dimensions. We will adjust it for you and the price will remain the same. Please keep in mind that if both sides are below 1 inch (3cm), we will need to print your stickers on sheets.





Can you print only one sticker of my design?


It will depend on the size and the material. We have a required minimum of stickers of the same design that we have to print. If you want only one sticker, you might want to consider our A4 vinyl sheets.





What is the minimum order for custom stickers?


The minimum order for die-cut custom stickers is $25. This option is for glossy-coated white vinyl. The number of stickers will depend on the size. The color and cut do not affect the minimum order. You may go to our custom sticker page to see additional prices. The minimum order for custom stickers is $10, this option is a sheet of stickers. This sheet is about an 8.5"" x 11"" (21.6x28 cm)page you can fill with as many stickers will fit. You can upload multiple designs here or fill the sheet with one design. These sheets are kiss cut where the individual sticker will peel away from the sheet.





Is there a way to upload multiple designs at one time?


No, each design needs to be saved as an individual file and uploaded as its own sticker. You can then save that to your cart and upload your next file.





Why are my stickers changing size when I upload my file?


When making stickers with the contour cutline, our editor will keep the original proportions of your artwork. For example: If your artwork is originally 3""x2"" (7.6x5 cm), with the contour cut, there is no way to make the stickers 3""x3"" (7.6x7.6 cm).

<div id=""collapseOne"" class=""panel-collapse collapse"" aria-expanded=""false"">
<div class=""panel-body"">
<p>A kiss-cut sticker is essentially a sticker surrounded by removable backing material that's larger than the sticker itself. The term 'kiss cut' refers to the laser-cutting technique used to cut around the sticker while leaving the backing material intact, so that the two are effectively &ldquo;kissing&rdquo;.</p>

</div>
<div id=""collapseTwo"" class=""panel-collapse collapse"">
<div class=""panel-body"">Absolutely! Kiss-cut stickers are specifically designed to be peelable stickers on a single sheet. Each sticker is precisely cut, allowing for easy removal while keeping the surrounding backing intact. This format ensures convenience during application and storage, making kiss-cut stickers a versatile and user-friendly option for various purposes.</div>

<div class=""panel-body"">Certainly! We offer custom sticker sheets specifically for this purpose. With custom sticker sheets, you have the flexibility to include multiple kiss-cut stickers of different designs on a single sheet, allowing for convenient storage and application. For more details and options, please refer to our custom sticker sheets or single sheets section, where you can explore the possibilities of creating unique and diverse sticker collections on a single sheet.</div>

<div class=""panel-body"">To set up your file, it's recommended to save it with two cutline layers: one for the inner kiss cut and another for the die cut that goes through. Make sure to lock the layer that represents the die cut. If you're not using design programs with layers, you can simply upload your complete design and provide us with instructions on which part should be designated for the kiss cut. This allows us to accurately produce your desired kiss-cut stickers while ensuring a seamless and precise cutting process.</div>

 FAQ





What is a kiss cut sticker?



A kiss-cut sticker is essentially a sticker surrounded by removable backing material that's larger than the sticker itself. The term 'kiss cut' refers to the laser-cutting technique used to cut around the sticker while leaving the backing material intact, so that the two are effectively “kissing”.






Can I get them on single sheets?


Absolutely! Kiss-cut stickers are specifically designed to be peelable stickers on a single sheet. Each sticker is precisely cut, allowing for easy removal while keeping the surrounding backing intact. This format ensures convenience during application and storage, making kiss-cut stickers a versatile and user-friendly option for various purposes.





 Is it possible to get different kiss cut stickers on one sheet?


Certainly! We offer custom sticker sheets specifically for this purpose. With custom sticker sheets, you have the flexibility to include multiple kiss-cut stickers of different designs on a single sheet, allowing for convenient storage and application. For more details and options, please refer to our custom sticker sheets or single sheets section, where you can explore the possibilities of creating unique and diverse sticker collections on a single sheet.





How do I set up my file?


To set up your file, it's recommended to save it with two cutline layers: one for the inner kiss cut and another for the die cut that goes through. Make sure to lock the layer that represents the die cut. If you're not using design programs with layers, you can simply upload your complete design and provide us with instructions on which part should be designated for the kiss cut. This allows us to accurately produce your desired kiss-cut stickers while ensuring a seamless and precise cutting process.
