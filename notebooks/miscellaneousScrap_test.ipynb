We believe that the environmental impact of having a different, subpar material that needs to be replaced will cause a more damaging effect on the world.

Please note that delivery times are provided as guidelines only, and commence from the date of dispatch. The delivery times do not take into account possible delays caused by payment authorization and/or stock availability. If you need your purchase urgently, please contact us before placing your order so that we will have the opportunity to investigate whether we can deliver according to your wishes. [Delays can also be caused by the artwork uploaded being in low resolution or otherwise unsuitable to print. We aim to handle communication efficiently to minimise such delays, but in these cases we are often dependent on new files being sent for production to commence.]',\n",
